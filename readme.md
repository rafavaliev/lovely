# Lovely

Lovely is a python library that inserts emojis to images with a face. 


### Requirements
1. Python 3
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (opencv, numpy)

### Run
`python main.py *path_to_image.jpeg*`

### Why insert emoji image and not just ❤️?
I tried to use `Pillow` to write emojis, but it doesn't work as expected. If you want to fix it, just do it.
